Add Schema.org markup to your WP Job Manger pages and job listings.

== Description ==
Schema.org markup is a way of giving search engines more information about your website so that they can automatically process your pages and display that to users.

Google is now supporting JobPostings schemas, and will eventually use these to produce dedicated job listing search results.  That's why it's important that YOUR site has schema markup installed so that your listings will appear.

This simple plugin will work alongside your WP Job Manager install and provide this schema for you, with no fuss and no editing required.

We also provide built-in support for two helpful WP Job Manager extensions:
* Application deadline
* Geolocation

== Installation ==
AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WPJM Schema” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking Install Now.

MANUAL INSTALLATION

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application.

Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

The plugin works straight out of the box, so there\'s no other options to configure.
